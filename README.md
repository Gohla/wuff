Short introduction: 

Wuff is not yet another tool for integrating gradle in Eclipse-IDE. 
It is a tool for developing and assembling Eclipse applications **independently** of Eclipse-IDE. 
Typical examples: 1) continuous delivery 2) use non-Eclipse IDEs like Netbeans.

If you are familiar with Eclipse Tycho, then think of Wuff as a more powerful, gradle-based, replacement for Tycho.

If you are new with wuff, good starting point would be [wiki pages](../../wiki).

If you already use wuff, it is always a good idea to look in [what's new section](whatsnew.md).
