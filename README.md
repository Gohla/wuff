### Introduction

Wuff is a gradle plugin for developing and assembling OSGi/Eclipse applications and plugins *independently* of Eclipse-IDE. If you are familiar with [Eclipse Tycho](https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/), then think of Wuff as a gradle-based alternative.

### Where to start?

If you want to create something from scratch, take a look at the tutorials: 
[first Equinox app](../../wiki/Create-first-Equinox-app), [first RCP app](../../wiki/Create-first-RCP-app) and [first IDE app](../../wiki/Create-first-IDE-app).

If you already have bunch of existing Eclipse plugins and apps, consider [converting them to Gradle/Wuff](../../wiki/Convert-existing-Eclipse-plugins-and-apps-to-Gradle).

You can systematically learn all about Wuff at [wiki pages](../../wiki).

If you already use Wuff, it is always a good idea to look in [what's new](whatsnew.md) file.

### How to use Wuff?

- Maven artifacts: 'org.akhikhl.wuff:wuff-plugin:+' at jcenter and maven central.
- Source code: compile, explore, deploy.

See more information on [prerequisites and usage](../../wiki/Prerequisites-and-usage) wiki page.
